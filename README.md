# HypixelRankGenerator

## What is it?
HypixelRankGenerator is a bot that I made after my friend [Geek](https://twitter.com/GamingGeekHD) suggested that I made a program that turns a Hypixel rank, e.g: ``&d[PIG&b+&d]`` into an image with a transparent background, so I made it into a discord bot!

## How does it work?
The bot uses PIL to generate an image and draw text to that image, once it's drawn it saves it to ``./temp/`` and uploads the file to Discord!
